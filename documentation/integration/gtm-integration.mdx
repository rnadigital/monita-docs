6. Select Google Account. You may see a different screen if the user is not logged into any Google account, or the target Google account is not logged in.
<Warning>Selected account must have full-write access to the container being monitored. Failure to have adequete perrmissions will result in monitoring errors. At a minimum, the account must be able to modify containers and container versions. Currently Monita does not Publish via the integration. The user is required to published manually. This is done to ensure user had total control over release cycle of GTM.</Warning>
