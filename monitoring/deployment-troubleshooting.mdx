Please check the following steps before contacting support.

###  1. Confirm that any Monita changes in the tag manager have been 'Submitted' or 'Published' to production
<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Google Tag Manager">
        ![Click Submit Button](/images/monitoring/troubleshooting-deployment-submit-button.png)
        Make sure to submit any changes Monita has made in the default workspace your tag manager container. Be careful not to deploy any of your own unfinished work.

        After submitting Monita changes, the workspace changes should be blank and your container version should have increased.

    <Accordion title="Adobe Launch">
        In order for Monita to receive requests you must Publish the monita_setup_library to the appropriate environment (dev/staging/prod).

        </Frame>
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### 2. Please fire off any tags which you have monitored
Monita will not receive data unless the tags which you have monitored have fired. To make your life easier we recommend you monitor an all pages tag.
<Accordion title="Network request checking on Chrome Network Tab">
    To confirm that data is being sent to Monita on the client side:
    1. Open the dev console (by pressing F12)
    2. Select the network tab
    3. search for raptor.digital
    4. Open the payload and Confirm requests being sent to monita
