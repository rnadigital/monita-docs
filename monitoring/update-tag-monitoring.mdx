<Note>By default Monita will create a workspace called "Monita Deployment Workspace" and push any required Monita template changes to that workpspace. 
If you are using the free version GTM, make sure to have no more than 2 workspaces in use as there is a limit of 3 workspaces. In these cases Monita will push to the default workspace.</Note>

5. Upon completion a Domain Setup modal will close.
6. Enter into the target Monita Deployment Workspace and verify the changes.
