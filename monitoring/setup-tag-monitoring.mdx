9. You can either Preview or Submit your container to production.
<Note>If previewing tags, they will fire as usual, although traffic will not be admitted to Monita so that outliers are not introduced to your production data.</Note>
10. Your integration and GTM setup is now complete. You will now need to integrate to Google Data Studio or your Visualisation platform of choice.
